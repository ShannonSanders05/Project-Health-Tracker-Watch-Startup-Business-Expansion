## Project Title: Health-Tracker-Watch-Startup-Business Expansion

**Description**:

Working in a data analyst team for the health tracker startup. The startup needed to gather insights into the best US states to expand their business taking into consideration various factors such as population, property prices, state income healthcare spending per person, etc. The business questions brought forward by the startup company were the following:

1. Identify the most disciplined and undisciplined employees and divisions;

2. Create a visualization with the analysis of weekdays and months when
most employees were late/absent (either for vacation or sick leave);

3. Which heads of departments tend to forgive
employees for lack of discipline? Are there any favorites for any heads of
departments?
